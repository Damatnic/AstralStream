# MX Player-Style Gestures Test Report

## Test Date: July 27, 2025
## Test Video: Elephants Dream (653 seconds duration)

## Test Results

### ✅ Single Tap - WORKING
- **Test**: Tap at center (906, 1088)
- **Result**: "Single tap detected"
- **Function**: Toggles player controls visibility

### ✅ Double Tap Left - WORKING
- **Test**: Double tap at x=400 (left half)
- **Result**: "Double tap left detected" → "seekRelative: deltaMs=-10000"
- **Function**: Rewinds 10 seconds correctly

### ✅ Double Tap Right - WORKING
- **Test**: Double tap at x=1600 (right half)
- **Result**: "Double tap right detected" → "seekRelative: deltaMs=10000"
- **Function**: Fast forwards 10 seconds correctly

### ✅ Long Press - WORKING
- **Test**: Long press for 1000ms
- **Result**: "Long press detected - starting 2x speed playback" → "End long press speed - restoring 1x"
- **Function**: Plays at 2x speed while pressed, returns to 1x when released

### ✅ Brightness Control - WORKING
- **Test**: Vertical swipe in left zone (x=400)
- **Result**: System brightness adjusted (seen in DisplayManagerService logs)
- **Function**: Brightness changes with vertical swipe in left 40% zone

### ✅ Volume Control - WORKING
- **Test**: Vertical swipe in right zone (x=1600)
- **Result**: "adjustVolume: delta=0.3354798" → "Current volume: 1.0"
- **Function**: Volume adjusts with vertical swipe in right 40% zone

### ⚠️ Center Zone Seek - NEEDS ADJUSTMENT
- **Test**: Horizontal swipe in center zone (800→1200)
- **Result**: Detected as single taps instead of swipe
- **Issue**: Minimum swipe distance might be too high for center zone

### ✅ Strong Horizontal Seek - WORKING
- **Test**: Strong horizontal swipe (200→1800)
- **Result**: "Seek drag" → Multiple seek updates → "Seek gesture ended"
- **Function**: Seeks correctly with strong horizontal swipe anywhere

## Zone Detection - WORKING
- Zone boundaries calculated correctly: left=[0, 870.4], center=[870.4, 1305.6], right=[1305.6, 2176.0]
- All touches correctly identified in their respective zones

## Summary

7 out of 8 gestures are working correctly. The only issue is with subtle horizontal swipes in the center zone being detected as taps instead of swipes. This is likely due to:

1. The minimum swipe distance (20 pixels) might be too high
2. The swipe detection threshold needs tuning for the center zone

## Recommendations

1. Reduce `minimumSwipeDistance` from 20f to 10f for better sensitivity
2. Add specific handling for center zone swipes with lower threshold
3. Consider adjusting swipe detection timing for better responsiveness
