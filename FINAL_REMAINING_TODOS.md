# Final Remaining TODOs and Missing Integrations

## Scan Date: 2025-07-26

After completing the initial task list and performing a comprehensive scan of the codebase, here are the remaining TODOs and missing integrations:

## 1. Missing Implementations

### 1.1 Rate App Functionality
**Location:** `MainActivity.kt:519`
```kotlin
onClick = { /* TODO */ }
```
**Action Required:** Implement Play Store rating functionality

### 1.2 Playlist Integration in Folder Browser
**Location:** `FolderBrowserActivity.kt:237`
```kotlin
onAddToPlaylist = { file ->
    // TODO: Implement playlist functionality
}
```
**Action Required:** Connect folder browser to playlist system

### 1.3 Version Click Handler
**Location:** `SettingsScreen.kt:139`
```kotlin
onClick = {}
```
**Action Required:** Show version info dialog or changelog

### 1.4 Advanced Player Settings
**Location:** `MxPlayerMenus.kt:68-69`
```kotlin
// TODO: Implement other settings
else -> { /* TODO: Add implementation */ }
```
**Action Required:** Implement remaining MxPlayer menu settings

### 1.5 Advanced Settings Screen
**Location:** `ModernVideoPlayerScreen.kt:133`
```kotlin
Text("Advanced settings coming soon...")
```
**Action Required:** Create advanced settings UI

## 2. Localization TODOs

**Location:** `LocalizationManager.kt:758-768`

Missing translations for:
- Italian
- Portuguese  
- Russian
- Chinese
- Japanese
- Korean
- Arabic
- Hindi
- Turkish
- Polish
- Dutch

**Action Required:** Implement proper translations for each language

## 3. Missing Features/Integrations

### 3.1 Actual Frame Capture
The current frame capture implementation returns a placeholder bitmap. Real video frame extraction needs to be implemented using:
- MediaCodec
- Surface-to-bitmap conversion
- Or Media3's built-in frame extraction

### 3.2 Thumbnail Generation
Video thumbnails are currently showing placeholder icons. Need to implement:
- Thumbnail extraction from video files
- Caching system for thumbnails
- Background thumbnail generation

### 3.3 Live Streaming Enhancement
Current RTMP streaming is simulated. Need real implementation for:
- RTMP protocol support
- RTSP streaming
- HLS/DASH adaptive streaming improvements

### 3.4 Picture-in-Picture (PiP)
No PiP support currently implemented. This is a standard feature for modern video players.

### 3.5 Background Playback
No background audio playback when app is minimized.

### 3.6 Chromecast Support
The "Cast" chip in MainActivity is decorative - no actual casting implementation.

### 3.7 AI Subtitles
The "AI Subtitles" chip in MainActivity is decorative - no actual AI subtitle generation.

## 4. Quality Improvements

### 4.1 Settings Persistence
While DataStore is implemented, not all settings are actually being used:
- Gesture settings not connected to gesture system
- Playback settings not connected to player
- Need to wire up all preferences

### 4.2 Error Handling
Some areas lack proper error handling:
- Network errors for streaming
- File permission errors
- Corrupt video file handling

### 4.3 Performance Optimizations
- Large folder scanning could be optimized
- Video list could use pagination
- Memory management for large playlists

## 5. UI/UX Polish

### 5.1 Loading States
Some operations don't show loading indicators:
- URL extraction
- Playlist operations
- Large folder scanning

### 5.2 Animations
Could add more animations for:
- Screen transitions
- List item animations
- Gesture feedback improvements

### 5.3 Dark/Light Theme
Currently only dark theme is implemented. No theme switching.

## 6. Testing Requirements

### 6.1 Unit Tests
No unit tests exist for:
- ViewModels
- Repositories
- Utility functions

### 6.2 UI Tests
No instrumented tests for:
- Gesture handling
- Player controls
- Navigation flows

## Implementation Priority

1. **High Priority:**
   - Connect playlist functionality in folder browser
   - Implement rate app functionality
   - Wire up settings to actual functionality
   - Proper frame capture implementation

2. **Medium Priority:**
   - Advanced player settings
   - Thumbnail generation
   - Picture-in-Picture support
   - Better error handling

3. **Low Priority:**
   - Localization for all languages
   - AI subtitle integration
   - Chromecast support
   - Theme switching

## Quick Fixes (Can be done immediately)

1. **Rate App Implementation:**
```kotlin
onClick = { 
    val uri = Uri.parse("market://details?id=${context.packageName}")
    val intent = Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW, uri)
    try {
        context.startActivity(intent)
    } catch (e: ActivityNotFoundException) {
        // Fallback to web
        val webUri = Uri.parse("https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=${context.packageName}")
        context.startActivity(Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW, webUri))
    }
}
```

2. **Playlist Integration in Folder Browser:**
```kotlin
onAddToPlaylist = { file ->
    // Show playlist selection dialog
    // Add video to selected playlist
}
```

3. **Version Click Handler:**
```kotlin
onClick = {
    // Show version dialog with changelog
}
```

## Conclusion

- ✅ Gesture controls
- ✅ Video playback
- ✅ Playlist management
- ✅ File browsing
- ✅ Settings screen
- ✅ About screen
