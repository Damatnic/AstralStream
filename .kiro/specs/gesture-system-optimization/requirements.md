# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on optimizing the existing gesture system in Astral-Vu to achieve MX Player-level smoothness and responsiveness, with particular emphasis on the long press speed-up gesture. The current implementation has a solid foundation but needs performance optimizations, smoother animations, and better responsiveness to match the industry-leading smoothness of MX Player.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a video player user, I want the long press speed-up gesture to be as smooth and responsive as MX Player, so that I can quickly navigate through videos without any lag or stuttering.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I long press on the left or right side of the screen THEN the speed progression SHALL start within 100ms
2. WHEN the speed increases (1x→2x→4x→8x→16x→32x) THEN each transition SHALL be smooth with no frame drops
3. WHEN I change direction during long press THEN the direction change SHALL be instant with no delay
4. WHEN I release the long press THEN the playback SHALL return to normal speed within 50ms
5. WHEN multiple speed changes occur rapidly THEN the system SHALL maintain 60fps performance

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a video player user, I want all gesture interactions to feel instantaneous and fluid, so that the app feels as responsive as premium video players like MX Player.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I perform any gesture (swipe, tap, long press) THEN the visual feedback SHALL appear within 16ms (one frame at 60fps)
2. WHEN I perform rapid gestures THEN the system SHALL not drop frames or lag
3. WHEN gestures conflict THEN the system SHALL resolve conflicts without noticeable delay
4. WHEN the device is under load THEN gesture responsiveness SHALL remain consistent
5. WHEN using the app on lower-end devices THEN gestures SHALL still feel smooth with adaptive performance

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a video player user, I want the gesture visual feedback to be polished and smooth, so that the interface feels modern and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I perform a long press gesture THEN the speed indicator SHALL animate smoothly with easing curves
2. WHEN the speed changes THEN the visual transition SHALL use appropriate motion design principles
3. WHEN I seek using gestures THEN the seek preview SHALL update smoothly without stuttering
4. WHEN volume or brightness changes THEN the overlay animations SHALL be fluid and responsive
5. WHEN gestures end THEN the fade-out animations SHALL be smooth and natural

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a video player user, I want the gesture system to be optimized for performance, so that it doesn't impact video playback quality or battery life.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN gestures are active THEN CPU usage SHALL not exceed 5% on modern devices
2. WHEN performing gestures THEN memory allocation SHALL be minimal with object pooling
3. WHEN the gesture system is idle THEN it SHALL consume minimal system resources
4. WHEN video is playing THEN gesture processing SHALL not interfere with video decoding
5. WHEN battery is low THEN the system SHALL automatically reduce gesture processing quality

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a video player user, I want the long press gesture to have fine-grained control options, so that I can customize the experience to match my preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access gesture settings THEN I SHALL be able to customize speed progression levels
2. WHEN I configure long press THEN I SHALL be able to set custom acceleration intervals
3. WHEN I use long press THEN I SHALL be able to enable/disable direction change during press
4. WHEN I want precise control THEN I SHALL be able to adjust sensitivity settings
5. WHEN I prefer different behavior THEN I SHALL be able to choose between MX Player style and custom modes

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a video player user, I want the gesture system to provide haptic feedback that enhances the experience, so that I can feel the interactions even when not looking at the screen.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I start a long press THEN I SHALL feel a subtle haptic pulse
2. WHEN speed increases during long press THEN I SHALL feel a distinct haptic pattern for each level
3. WHEN I change direction THEN I SHALL feel a directional haptic feedback
4. WHEN gestures conflict THEN I SHALL feel a warning haptic pattern
5. WHEN I can customize haptic intensity THEN the settings SHALL be persistent and responsive

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the gesture system to be architected for maximum performance, so that it can handle complex interactions without impacting the user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system processes gestures THEN it SHALL use efficient algorithms with O(1) complexity where possible
2. WHEN gesture events are generated THEN they SHALL be batched and throttled appropriately
3. WHEN memory is allocated THEN object pooling SHALL be used to minimize garbage collection
4. WHEN performance degrades THEN the system SHALL automatically adapt quality settings
5. WHEN debugging is needed THEN comprehensive performance metrics SHALL be available
