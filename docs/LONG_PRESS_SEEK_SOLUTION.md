# Long Press Seek Solution - MX Player Style Implementation

## Problem Statement
The original long press to seek functionality was not working properly like MX Player does. It needed to:
- Continue seeking until finger is lifted
- Increase/decrease speed based on how long the press is held
- Allow direction changes with left/right swipes during long press
- Provide visual feedback similar to MX Player

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Gesture Detection System
**File**: `android/app/src/main/java/com/astralplayer/nextplayer/feature/player/ui/SimpleVideoPlayerScreen.kt`

#### Key Components Added:
```kotlin
// State management for long press seeking
var isLongPressing by remember { mutableStateOf(false) }
var longPressDirection by remember { mutableStateOf<String?>(null) }
var longPressSpeed by remember { mutableStateOf(1f) }
var longPressStartTime by remember { mutableStateOf(0L) }
var showLongPressIndicator by remember { mutableStateOf(false) }
```

### 2. Multi-Layer Gesture Input System

#### Layer 1: Advanced Drag Gestures
- Handles brightness, volume, and seek gestures
- Prevents conflicts with long press
- 30px drag threshold for gesture activation

#### Layer 2: Tap and Long Press Detection
- Single tap: Toggle controls
- Double tap: Seek forward/backward (10s)
- Long press: Activate continuous seeking

#### Layer 3: Enhanced Long Press Tracking
- Real-time direction changes based on horizontal swipes
- Speed multiplier based on swipe intensity
- Proper cleanup on finger release

### 3. Accelerating Speed System

#### Speed Progression:
- **0-1 seconds**: 1x speed (1 second per update)
- **1-3 seconds**: 2x speed (2 seconds per update)
- **3-6 seconds**: 4x speed (4 seconds per update)
- **6+ seconds**: 8x speed (8 seconds per update)

#### Dynamic Speed Adjustment:
```kotlin
// Base speed from time held
val baseSpeed = when {
    elapsedTime < 1000L -> 1f
    elapsedTime < 3000L -> 2f
    elapsedTime < 6000L -> 4f
    else -> 8f
}

// Additional multiplier from swipe intensity
val swipeIntensity = kotlin.math.abs(deltaX) / size.width
val speedMultiplier = 1f + (swipeIntensity * 3f).coerceAtMost(3f)
longPressSpeed = baseSpeed * speedMultiplier
```

### 4. Direction Control System

#### Initial Direction:
- Left half of screen: Backward seeking
- Right half of screen: Forward seeking

#### Dynamic Direction Changes:
- 50px horizontal swipe threshold
- Real-time direction switching during long press
- Haptic feedback on direction change
- Visual indicator updates immediately

### 5. Visual Feedback System

#### Enhanced Long Press Indicator:
- **Rotating Icon**: Clockwise for forward, counterclockwise for backward
- **Speed Visualization**: Dots indicating current speed level
- **Real-time Position**: Current playback time display
- **Direction Labels**: "Fast Forward" or "Rewind"
- **User Instructions**: "Swipe horizontally to change direction"

#### Animation Features:
- Smooth scaling and glow effects
- Rotating icons with direction-based rotation
- Pulsing animations for active state
- Fade in/out transitions

### 6. Integration with Existing Systems

#### Haptic Feedback:
- Initial long press: 100ms strong vibration
- Direction change: 50ms medium vibration
- Respects user's haptic settings

#### Player Integration:
- Uses existing `viewModel.seekTo()` method
- Respects video boundaries (0 to totalDuration)
- Maintains playback state consistency
- 100ms update frequency for smooth seeking

## Technical Implementation Details

### Gesture State Machine:
1. **Press Down**: Initialize position tracking
2. **Long Press Detected**: Start continuous seeking
3. **Movement During Press**: Update direction and speed
4. **Release**: Clean up and stop seeking

### Performance Optimizations:
- Coroutine-based seeking for non-blocking UI
- Efficient state cleanup
- Minimal memory allocation during gestures
- Proper job cancellation

### Error Handling:
- Boundary checking for seek positions
- Graceful handling of gesture interruptions
- State reset on unexpected events

## User Experience Improvements

### Intuitive Controls:
1. **Touch and Hold**: Start seeking in direction based on touch position
2. **Swipe While Holding**: Change direction dynamically
3. **Hold Longer**: Automatically increase seeking speed
4. **Swipe Harder**: Increase speed multiplier
5. **Release**: Stop seeking immediately

### Visual Feedback:
- Clear indication of current action
- Speed level visualization
- Direction indicators
- Real-time position updates

### Accessibility:
- Haptic feedback for tactile confirmation
- Clear visual indicators
- Consistent with app's design language

## Testing Results

### Build Status: ✅ SUCCESS
- No compilation errors
- Only minor warnings (deprecated icons, unused variables)
- All gesture systems integrated properly

### Functionality Verified:
- [x] Long press activation
- [x] Speed acceleration over time
- [x] Direction changes with swipes
- [x] Visual feedback display
- [x] Proper cleanup on release
- [x] Integration with existing gestures
