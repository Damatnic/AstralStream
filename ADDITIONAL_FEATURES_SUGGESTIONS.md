@Composable
fun SleepTimerDialog(
    onDismiss: () -> Unit,
    onSetTimer: (Long) -> Unit
) {
    val presetTimes = listOf(
        15L to "15 minutes",
        30L to "30 minutes",
        45L to "45 minutes",
        60L to "1 hour",
        90L to "1.5 hours",
        120L to "2 hours"
    )
    
    var customTime by remember { mutableStateOf("") }
    var selectedPreset by remember { mutableStateOf<Long?>(null) }
    
    AlertDialog(
        onDismissRequest = onDismiss,
        title = { Text("Sleep Timer") },
        text = {
            Column {
                // Preset times
                presetTimes.forEach { (minutes, label) ->
                    Row(
                        modifier = Modifier
                            .fillMaxWidth()
                            .clickable { selectedPreset = minutes }
                            .padding(vertical = 8.dp),
                        verticalAlignment = Alignment.CenterVertically
                    ) {
                        RadioButton(
                            selected = selectedPreset == minutes,
                            onClick = { selectedPreset = minutes }
                        )
                        Text(label, modifier = Modifier.padding(start = 8.dp))
                    }
                }
                
                // Custom time
                OutlinedTextField(
                    value = customTime,
                    onValueChange = { customTime = it },
                    label = { Text("Custom (minutes)") },
                    keyboardOptions = KeyboardOptions(keyboardType = KeyboardType.Number),
                    modifier = Modifier.fillMaxWidth()
                )
            }
        },
        confirmButton = {
            TextButton(
                onClick = {
                    val minutes = selectedPreset ?: customTime.toLongOrNull() ?: 0
                    if (minutes > 0) {
                        onSetTimer(minutes * 60 * 1000) // Convert to milliseconds
                        onDismiss()
                    }
                }
            ) {
                Text("Set Timer")
            }
        },
        dismissButton = {
            TextButton(onClick = onDismiss) {
                Text("Cancel")
            }
        }
    )
}
```
